test system: slow ARM with 2TB disk and ca. 750GB data.

original version using Ash and Sed: 39 minutes
original version replacing one Sed with shell mechanics: 33 minutes
with awk: 1 minute 20
only dumpe2fs: 1 minute 6

so awk takes like 14 seconds, and Ash takes over 30 minutes using sed and grep to accomplish the same.

full read time of disk itself (skipping holes): slightly less than 4 hours.

checksum benchmarks:

reading a 161M file on the same host sees:
- cksum ~ 7.47 seconds ( 4 runs)
- md5sum -b  ~ 7.35 seconds ( 4 runs )
- sha1sum -b ~ 13.18 seconds ( 1 run )
- sum   ~ 10.89 seconds ( 2 runs )
